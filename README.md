# Speed & Ping Tests for Cloud Hosting Providers

## Notes

- Speed tests for ***each region of each provider*** (there are over 80) can use **up to 100MB of data**. Be careful if your ISP caps your data usage!
- Files are downloaded via HTTP (not HTTPS) to get pure speed without encryption overhead.
- Tests can always be influenced by outside variables. Run the scripts multiple times if you want to ensure accuracy. Evil throttling ISPs can mess up the results too, of course.
- If it looks like the script has crashed, the current test is probably just taking a while â€” especially when testing far-away regions. If you already know that testing other continents is futile, just remove them from the for loops in `speed.sh`.
- **Thank you to [CloudHarmony](https://cloudharmony.com/) for providing AWS and GCP endpoints for testing!**

## Usage

If you trust me (which you shouldn't, _please_ don't trust random people on the internet!) these commands will download and run the scripts automatically:

```
wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakejarvis/datacenter-speed-tests/master/ping.sh | bash
wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakejarvis/datacenter-speed-tests/master/speed.sh | bash
```

Or, clone the repository and make sure the scripts are executable before running:

```
git clone https://github.com/jakejarvis/datacenter-speed-tests.git
cd datacenter-speed-tests
chmod +x ping.sh && chmod +x speed.sh
./ping.sh
./speed.sh
```
